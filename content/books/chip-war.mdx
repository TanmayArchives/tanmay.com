The entire history of the semiconductor industry. Covers the stories of all the famous founders & scientists involved, the important technical breakthroughs, the developments in the manufacturing value chain, and the geopolitical forces that have shaped and been shaped by this technology.

Interesting to learn about the dynamics of how economic incentives have made this the most rapidly innovating industry in human history. Also made me appreciate the urgency of the United States vs. China conflict over who controls the chip manufacturing supply chain.
