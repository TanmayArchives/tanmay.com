A surprisingly concise book on the power of feeling and belief in achievement. Similar to _Think And Grow Rich_, but focused just on the metaphysical and less targeted to a general audience.

Powerful lessons about the relationship between the conscious & the subconscious, and how to use this knowledge to enable creation.

Best introduced with an excerpt from Neville - "the world, and all within it, is man's conditioned consciousness objectified. Consciousness is the cause as well as the substance of the entire world. So it is to consciousness that we must turn if we would discover the secret of creation."

If this excerpt sounds like bullshit to you, this book is not for you. If you recognize the truth in it, you will enjoy the rest of the book.
