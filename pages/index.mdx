**Some things about me:**

- I'm a Software engineer at [DepressionHUB](https://twitter.com/Depression_hub0). We [Help People](https://depressionhub.vercel.app/) "Find people who are in the same emotional state as them, connect with them, and help each other navigate life's ups and downs.and more..."
- I have dropped out of the University of "National Institute of Technology Srinagar" , where I was studying for a Bachelor of Technology.
- I like creating things (writing, coding, startups). Startups are cool because they make creating things profitable & scalable.
- My personal philosophy has changed drastically over the past decade. My current worldview is most aligned with [non-dualism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nondualism) & [advaita vedanta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advaita_Vedanta).

**Some things I'm interested in:**

- Theories about psychological and philosophical development. Especially [ego development theory](https://www.actualized.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/9-levels-of-ego-development-cook-greuter.pdf) (development of self-awareness) and [spiral dynamics](https://www.amazon.com/Spiral-Dynamics-Mastering-Values-Leadership/dp/1405133562) (development of personal psychology).
- Neuroscience & psychedelics. They combine most of my biggest interests - computation, intelligence, learning, consciousness, philosophy.
- Education, especially for kids under the age of 5, where many critical behaviors are solidifed.
- I like learning about new things, especially from people who are passionate about what they're teaching.
- I like beautiful art of all forms (tv, movies, visual arts, music, games). Good art creates a feeling that can't be replicated by anything else.
